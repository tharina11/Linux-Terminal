Bash stands for Bourne Again SHell
Created in 1989
It's the command line in linux wrapped around the linux kernel
Bash scripting is automating everything we type in the shell

You write different types of scripts in Linux (BASH, Python, GO etc)
Using '#!/bin/bash' we tell the bash interpreter what scripting language we want to use for the particular script. Always do that in your script.

To save a bash script, hit 'ctrl+X' and follow instructions.
Run a bash script with - 'bash scriptname.sh'

If you can't execute a file, make it executable by giving permission as shown below.
'-rw-rw-r--' - rw - read, write
'chmod +x filename.sh' will convert the file into a executable format. 

Create a variable as name= 'Ben'. Then use it as $name in your bash script

'read name' - 'read' will store the user input in the 'name' variable

name=$1 - This is a positional parameter. When we run the script, whatever the parameter we put after the script, matchup to $1.
These variables can be equal to the outputs of commands
whoami- who are you logged in as
pwd - print working directory
date - print current date time

user=$(whoami) assigns the output of the command to the user variable

RANDOM - generates a random number between 0 and 32767. RANDOM is a prebuilt variable in linux
twitter="Elon Musk" This is how to create a system variable. But this variable cannot be used in a script yet. Because you cannot use it in a child process. 
export twitter- Convert it to an environment variable to use it in a script.
In linux, when a file has a dot in front of the file name, it is hidden. You have to type la -al to view the hidden files.
Bashrc is a script that runs everytime you log in. It will set make sure that everything works.
If you need to make a variable permanent, edit the .bashrc file
