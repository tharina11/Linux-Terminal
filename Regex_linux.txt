Linux Regex commands
There are three different versions of regular expression syntax:

BRE: Basic Regular expressions
ERE: Extended Regular expressions
PRCE: Perl Regular Expressions

grep - print lines matching a pattern
       grep has -E option to force a string to be read as ERE. 
PRCE and ERE both use the pipe symbol for 'or'.
